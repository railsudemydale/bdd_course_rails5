*- visit root
*- click on sign-up link
*- email
*- password
*- password confirmation

     Invalid signup
*- do an invalid sign-up and ensure that it fails

*- Articles will belong to users
*- Users will own articles
*- Users - 1 side of this
*- 1 user can have many articles
*- an article can only belong to 1 user
*- foreign key of user_id in the articles table

Steps:
1) Create the spec
2) 

*-        Restrict Access-
*- Hide the "New Article" button from non-signed in users
*- Hide the "Edit" and "Delete" buttons from non-owners of the article
*- Permit the owners to edit or delete their own articles.

Homework: Do the same restrict access (controller) for delete

Please paste your code or your github repo
